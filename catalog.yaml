  h3: Tools to slow down the consumption of existence.
  desc: "<p>The greatest irony of the digital age is that we are constantly surrounded by devices which could free us, yet instead enslave us.</p>

    <p>Our modern times of meta consumerism are based upon technologies which have never better modeled the human condition. But how did we get here? We carry in our pockets digital mirrors which reduce the vividness of our beautiful, short existence into two dimensions of indistinguishable figure and ground. Reality thus blurred, we are steered through digital feedback loops, unaware or uncaring of the mediators who cultivate our addictions, catalog our every click, and measure our worth (literally and figuratively) by our browsing.</p>

    <p>It was not always so. The internet was once an artistic medium. Before the twelve column grid, Bootstrap and A/B testing, the internet was a hotbed of technoprimitivism, a highly intentional digital folk art. While the modern tools have given us new standards and undoubtedly improved utility and commerce, they have also given us homogeny, erased artistic intention and ossified design. A decade of design influenced by the mantra of <em>“Don’t Make Me Think”</em> has succeeded in its stated objective.</p>

    <p>lazerbea.ms was designed to make the viewer Think. While its construction benefits from many modern tools, its design retrieves a humanist intention of the Bauhaus sort, eschewing the grid and staid conventions but embracing the golden ratio and internal consistency. We think the internet is as worthy a medium as any other, and <strong>LB000</strong> is our line in the sand. #fuckinternet</p>

  h3: Candy coloured nights.
  desc: "<p>In this premier episode, Lazerbeams: Tonite<em>!</em> welcomes you to a post-future journey of neon sound. Electric machines find physical orgasms in our finite organisms and dress us in the penumbrae of otherworlds. We’re here, we’re sphere.

  h3: What spectacle confronted them?
  desc: "<p>The second episode of Lazerbeams: Tonite<em>!</em> brings meditations of evolution increasingly vaster. Side A opens with an electric luxury gliding machine gliding through the mirrored night of waterfront city blocks, the gluminous parinoia hyperconnecting of planets. Side B moves to warmerlands ('Relatable You') having inside coats lie by loving fire but what finds us there? Recorded live on September 15, 2016 at The Caged Unicorn in Portland, OR.

  title: 'Excitable André Finds Love in Sunrise Still'
  color: c77670
  h3: An illusion caused by the world spinning round.
  desc: "<p>The radiant stillness of morning sunrise shines within this beautiful, meditative session of solo saxophone and drum kit. A live, improvised, unfiltered expression, EVERGREEN (André Green) recorded this session after taking the photo above, on a day that would come to mark the beginning of a reclamation of both technology and spirit. It is the feeling of still surprising yourself, slowing down, and finding love in the moment.</p><p>This album is first in what will be a <em>solo solo</em> series -- a single individual, a single instrument, creating meditative orchestrations with no filter.</p><p>Recorded live on September 4, 2017 at The Caged Unicorn in Portland, OR.</p>"
