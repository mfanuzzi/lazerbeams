  h3: Tools to slow down the consumption of existence.
  desc: "<p>The greatest irony of the digital age is that we are constantly surrounded by devices which could free us, yet instead enslave us.</p>

    <p>Our modern times of meta consumerism are based upon technologies which have never better modeled the human condition. But how did we get here? We carry in our pockets digital mirrors which reduce the vividness of our beautiful, short existence into two dimensions of indistinguishable figure and ground. Reality thus blurred, we are steered through digital feedback loops, unaware or uncaring of the mediators who cultivate our addictions, catalog our every click, and measure our worth (literally and figuratively) by our browsing.</p>

    <p>It was not always so. The internet was once an artistic medium. Before the twelve column grid, Bootstrap and A/B testing, the internet was a hotbed of technoprimitivism, a highly intentional digital folk art. While the modern tools have given us new standards and undoubtedly improved utility and commerce, they have also given us homogeny, erased artistic intention and ossified design. A decade of design influenced by the mantra of <em>“Don’t Make Me Think”</em> has succeeded in its stated objective.</p>

    <p>lazerbea.ms was designed to make the viewer Think. While its construction benefits from many modern tools, its design retrieves a humanist intention of the Bauhaus sort, eschewing the grid and staid conventions but embracing the golden ratio and internal consistency. We think the internet is as worthy a medium as any other, and <strong>LB000</strong> is our line in the sand. #fuckinternet</p>

    <p><em>"To me, this album is a swirling universe of interstellar bodies, warm and full of liquid evolution." -MF</em></p> 

    <p>A swirling evolution, lazerbea.ms is proud to present the first video generated using LAZERFOCUS 2.0 technology. This is the very same technology that we use to create the cover art for LB:2N<em>!</em> episodes. Now with greater (e)motion.</p>

    <p>Life is multimodal, and so are we. With this video we present not simply an abstraction or simple accompaniment, but rather a story. A moment for you, dear viewer, to find your own meanings within this strange little universe. Find a place to land.</p>

  h3: An illusion caused by the world spinning round.
  desc: "<p>The radiant stillness of morning sunrise shines within this beautiful, meditative session of solo saxophone and drum kit. A live, improvised, unfiltered expression, EVERGREEN (André Bosquet) recorded this session on the day of the photo above; a day that would come to mark the beginning of a reclamation of both technology and spirit. It is the intersection of raga and mid 60s Coltrane as inspired by the mossy underbelly of the pacific northwest. But foremost, it is the feeling of still surprising yourself, slowing down, and reevaluating that which you take for granted.</p><p>This album is first in what will be a <em>solo solo</em> series -- a single individual, a single instrument, creating meditative orchestrations with no filter.</p><p>Recorded live on September 4, 2017 at The Caged Unicorn in Portland, OR.</p>"

  h3: What is bebop?
  desc: |
    <p><em>"it sounds like you got possessed by an 8-bit Ghost Pepper, and then you left your body to possess a neon jazz orchestra conducted by your physical body, possessed by said pepper" -Axton Frick</em></p>

    <p>Bebop '79 is genre bending jazz "duet" from Michael Fanuzzi (drums, guitar, voice) and continuing iterations of His Machine, Lazerbeat (piano, synthesizers).</p>

    <p>The Machine is, at a functional level, a clever means of playing multiple instruments at once, feeding off of the subtleties of percussion and the environment to generate fantastical melodies in response.</p>

    <p>But more than that, there's an unpredictable nature to it that makes it feel truly alive. The Machine is not only reacting, it is in itself creating. Together.</p>

    <p>This premier album was cut from the very first experiment with this real-time conduction technology. Note selection is driven directly by the drums, using a combination of pitch/percussion analysis, first from the drums, and later from the guitar, and even voice. Loops and layers are built, growing ever vaster in scale. The album opens with jaunty march of recursive high synth leads as the drums freely swing below. Later, as synths are changed to pianos ("Pianosolo"), we get a quite modern Scriabin/Jarrett/Iverson mashup. This leads into a piece of soaring poly strings and mallets ("Sky"), which subsequently combines all of the above into a bizarre and beautiful glitch landscape.</p>

    <p>Side B, borne from a single drum click, adds riotous guitar and vocal looping, from punk ("Orgasm") to choral ("Dawn"). In ☁ ▅▒░☼‿☼░▒▅ ☁, piano stabs fall from a sky of dreamy afrique electric guitar. Finally, the drum/piano combo returns once more ("Papi/Pills") for a moment that demonstrates in one way how truly modern jazz can be.</p>

    <p>Here at lazerbea.ms, we endeavor to utilize technology to achieve an artistic transcendence. A futuristic primitivism. Welcome to the opening chapter of BEBOP '79.</p>

    <p>This album was entirely improvised with no overdubs. Recorded live on August 26, 2017 at The Caged Unicorn in Portland, OR.</p>
