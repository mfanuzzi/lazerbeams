  h3: Tools to slow down the consumption of existence.
  desc: "<p>The greatest irony of the digital age is that we are constantly surrounded by devices which could free us, yet instead enslave us.</p>

    <p>The modern age of meta consumerism is based upon technologies which have never better modeled the human condition. But how did we get here? We carry in our pockets digital mirrors which reduce the vividness of our beautiful, short existence into two dimensions of indistinguishable figure and ground. Reality thus blurred, we are steered through digital feedback loops, unaware or uncaring of the mediators who cultivate our addictions, catalog our every click, and measure our worth (literally and figuratively) by our browsing.</p>

    <p>It was not always so. The internet was once an artistic medium. Before the twelve column grid, Bootstrap and A/B testing, the internet was a hotbed of technoprimitivism, a highly intentional digital folk art. While the modern tools have given us new standards and undoubtedly improved utility and commerce, they have also given us homogeny, erased artistic intention and ossified design. A decade of design influenced by the mantra of <em>“Don’t Make Me Think”</em> has succeeded in its stated objective.</p>

    <p>lazerbea.ms was designed to make the viewer Think. While its construction benefits from many modern tools, its design retrieves a humanist intention of the Bauhaus sort, eschewing the grid and staid conventions but embracing the golden ratio and internal consistency. We think the internet is as worthy a medium as any other, and <strong>LB000</strong> is our line in the sand.</p>
