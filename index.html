                                <h3>Tools to slow down the consumption of existence.</h3>
                                <div class="desc"><p>The greatest irony of the digital age is that we are constantly surrounded by devices which could free us, yet instead enslave us.</p>
<p>Our modern times of meta consumerism are based upon technologies which have never better modeled the human condition. But how did we get here? We carry in our pockets digital mirrors which reduce the vividness of our beautiful, short existence into two dimensions of indistinguishable figure and ground. Reality thus blurred, we are steered through digital feedback loops, unaware or uncaring of the mediators who cultivate our addictions, catalog our every click, and measure our worth (literally and figuratively) by our browsing.</p>
<p>It was not always so. The internet was once an artistic medium. Before the twelve column grid, Bootstrap and A/B testing, the internet was a hotbed of technoprimitivism, a highly intentional digital folk art. While the modern tools have given us new standards and undoubtedly improved utility and commerce, they have also given us homogeny, erased artistic intention and ossified design. A decade of design influenced by the mantra of <em>“Don’t Make Me Think”</em> has succeeded in its stated objective.</p>
<p>lazerbea.ms was designed to make the viewer Think. While its construction benefits from many modern tools, its design retrieves a humanist intention of the Bauhaus sort, eschewing the grid and staid conventions but embracing the golden ratio and internal consistency. We think the internet is as worthy a medium as any other, and <strong>LB000</strong> is our line in the sand.</p> </div>

A live, improvised, unfiltered expression, EVERGREEN (André Bosquet) recorded this session on the day of the photo above; a day that would come to mark the beginning of a reclamation of both technology and spirit. It is the intersection of raga and mid 60s Coltrane as inspired by the mossy underbelly of the pacific northwest. But foremost, it is the feeling of still surprising yourself, slowing down, and reevaluating that which you take for granted.</p><p>This album is first in what will be a <em>solo solo</em> series -- a single individual, a single instrument, creating meditative orchestrations with no filter.</p><p>Recorded live on September 4, 2017 at The Caged Unicorn in Portland, OR.</p></div>

<p>Bebop '79 is genre bending jazz "duet" from Michael Fanuzzi (drums, guitar, voice) and continuing iterations of His Machine, Lazerbeat (piano, synthesizers).</p>

<p>The Machine is, at a functional level, a clever means of playing multiple instruments at once, feeding off of the subtleties of percussion and the environment to generate fantastical melodies in response.</p>

<p>But more than that, there's an unpredictable nature to it that makes it feel truly alive. The Machine is not only reacting, it is in itself creating. Together.</p>

<p>This premier album was cut from the very first experiment with this real-time conduction technology. Note selection is driven directly by the drums, using a combination of pitch/percussion analysis, first from the drums, and later from the guitar, and even voice. Loops and layers are built, growing ever vaster in scale. The album opens with jaunty march of recursive high synth leads as the drums freely swing below. Later, as synths are changed to pianos ("Pianosolo"), we get a quite modern Scriabin/Jarrett/Iverson mashup. This leads into a piece of soaring poly strings and mallets ("Sky"), which subsequently combines all of the above into a bizarre and beautiful glitch landscape.</p>

<p>Side B, borne from a single drum click, adds riotous guitar and vocal looping, from punk ("Orgasm") to choral ("Dawn"). In ☁ ▅▒░☼‿☼░▒▅ ☁, piano stabs fall from a sky of dreamy afrique electric guitar. Finally, the drum/piano combo returns once more ("Papi/Pills") for a moment that demonstrates in one way how truly modern jazz can be.</p>

<p>Here at lazerbea.ms, we endeavor to utilize technology to achieve an artistic transcendence. A futuristic primitivism. Welcome to the opening chapter of BEBOP '79.</p>

<p>This album was entirely improvised with no overdubs. Recorded live on August 26, 2017 at The Caged Unicorn in Portland, OR.</p>

                                <div class="desc"><p>The Caged Unicorn (lazerbeams studio) is the culmination of years of careful planning and research into creating a space that can be creative, inspiring and facilitating to the types of music we want to create, as solo projects, duos, or more. It has become a very productive space indeed, but it is ultimately a basement, under a house, set in stone, with limited space for others to particpate in the creation.</p>

<p>Several months ago, I was given the opportunity to play the <a href="http://creativemusicguild.org/" target="_blank">Creative Music Guild</a>'s Outset series as Bebop '79. Lazerbeat is but one part of the Caged Unicorn, but weeks of work were neccesary to liberate it into something self-sufficient. Once the technical challege was completed, I explored the scenes that might be created in a live environment, and ways the sound and responses might challenge myself and an audience to connect to my mechanical musical partner. As this performance -- as all Bebop performances -- are improvised, we're not so much creating "songs" as much as scenes of a play. A performance art in sound.</p>

<p>The resultant 30 minute set travels trhough places both new and familiar. Starting with a nod to the staccato bleeps of <a href="#lb004"><em>what is bebop '79? where is?</em></a>, we progress into both warm and cold puddles of sound, radiating outward from the drum. We move into the jazz piano, impossibly and langourously bent in space. As loops of voice and saxophone come in, epic synths follow their footsteps. The final piece, beginning as an arpeggiated abstraction before building into layers of swirling sound underneath an intense alto, is as great of a representation of what is <em>Bebop</em> as has ever been committed to tape.</p>

<p>We melded & transcended, expressing love, gratitude.</p>

                                <div class="desc"><p><em>"There is music which would need a hundred paintings to express it." -Pound</em></p>

<p>Music, at its most essential, could be described as a series of tension and release. Our cultures provide means of expression for this in scale, harmony, rhythm: those of us in the west are inculcated with the major/minor keys, the 4/4 beat, polyphony dating back to liturgical chant. It's this last one that provides the most interesting vantage point, preceding the epoch of "western"/"eastern" division. Here there are unities to be found which may be indeed called universal: when singing in unison, we feel the physical perfection of the fifth in its resonance. If we let ourselves be driven by this sensuality, and shape an external energy after our own resonance, we may find there a path to sublimity.</p>

<p>This is the second full length album from Bebop '79, a performance of Michael Fanuzzi and his machine, LAZERBEAT, that generates melody through the comprehension of the tonal content of percussion.  Functionally, we illustrate that piano, voice, reed and snare are separated only by degree, and the machine can provide a connective tissue (and here the machine has been evolved in several dimensions of complexity from the previous album, "what is bebop '79? where is?", yet still retains a directness: no generative parlor tricks like ML or probabilistic modeling are used). The resultant organism is cybernetic; an extension of human expression through explosion of possibility. Intention flows from the analog to digital and back again in a perfect circle. Awareness is a constant that elevates beyond mimicry into creation.</p>

<p>Throughout the album, the machine is voiced in a sostenuto, sine-like timbre that individuates it from the human in both form and content. Fanuzzi, at times, uses looping of his voice, sax, guitar and etc. to direct the piece and bring both to different expressions. The key point is that each player here has a voice. This is a duo work in the truest sense, a synthesis not just of motions and electrons, but rather an iteration and evolution of the INNERER KLANG.</p>

<p>With <em>Bebop ’79</em>, I explore the possibilities for shaping resonant, external energy by union of rhythm and melody. This is achieved by a more fundamental union of percussion and sonority, driven by a machine — LAZERBEAT — I’ve developed to actualize this union in real time. The result is a <strong>cybernetic expressionism</strong>.</p>

<p>In this essay, I introduce the <em>Bebop ’79</em> project and explain how the technology works at a practical level in performance. This is used as the ground from which I explore greater questions for both audiences and artists: does man and machine form a duet? What is the significance of a machine’s tone of voice? I explore the perceptual differences in man and machine, their consequences for art and experience of time, and assert the primacy of the sensorial. I expose the hidden life of the musical improvisor, and consider the artistic benefits of machines that are unaware of our cultural mores. I consider what separates living artwork from dead ones, art from propaganda, and from mere output. I posit that the modernist method is abstraction, and advocate for active participation. I depict both the complexities of representation for the cybernetic artist and the opportunities, through dissection of the conceptual and the supernatural, and why I reject the “generative.” Finally, through the metaphor of bebop and the arts of 1979, I forge a path forward that aims to reconcile contemporary technological ecologies with the cultural desires that enabled their creations in the first place.</p>

Performed live using only simple tools: one guitar, distortion pedal, looper and amplifier. Through these small means a great complexity is constructed; its layers a transcendent reflection of nature, distance and time, graceful as snow and sharp as daggers. It is a reflection of the beginning of the winter rains, the onset of the crystal cold, and the warmth within. Ride the wave ~~~</p>
